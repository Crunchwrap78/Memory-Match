Technologies Used
Html/CSS
Javascript/Jquery

Thoughts?
If we had learned Jquery first, it would have made this project a breeze. I got help from outside friends stating I needed to implement Jquery, or I'd 
be asking for trouble. I'm satified with the project and how it came out.
I will never understand why it gave an infinite loop when using while to go through the counter for the medium and hard mode.
I wish I had more time to implement other things like a timer, and instead of a prompt that asks for difficult, it's all shown on html.
